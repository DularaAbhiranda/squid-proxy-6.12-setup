Here’s how you can uninstall Squid from a Red Hat-based system and check if it’s removed:

1. Stop Squid service
sudo systemctl stop squid

2. Uninstall Squid

For RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:

sudo yum remove squid -y


or on newer Fedora versions:

sudo dnf remove squid -y

3. Remove leftover configuration and cache (optional but recommended)
sudo rm -rf /etc/squid
sudo rm -rf /var/spool/squid
sudo rm -rf /var/log/squid

4. Check if Squid is removed
which squid


If it returns nothing, Squid is removed.

squid -v


This should give command not found if fully removed.
